# Create the PostGIS in Action container

The container image is stored on Docker Hub. In order to access it, you will need Docker Hub account.

Log in so the image can be pulled

`docker login` 

Log in with your user name and password. Next time you won't need to supply these, because an authentication file is written to your local machine. The file is written by default to a config file in your user profile directory. `.docker/config.json`
